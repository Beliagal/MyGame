# MyGame
Conversational rpg made with Python.

Years ago, once of my first approaching to the rpg's was with a conversational game that I've found in the internet.
It was incredible to write and that program told you if your choice was right or not.

Later, I discovered games as "Ishtar", "Eye of the Beholder" and similars... and my love to rpg started.

Today, while I'm learning programming, I'm thinking about that first game where only text shaped the world.

Welcome to my fantasy.
